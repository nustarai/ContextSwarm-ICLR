Problem D
Buggy Rover
Time limit: 2 seconds
The International Center for Planetary Cartography (ICPC) uses
rovers to explore the surfaces of other planets. As we all know,
other planets are flat surfaces which can be perfectly and evenly
discretized into a rectangular grid structure. Each cell in this grid
is either flat and can be explored by the rover, or rocky and cannot.
Today marks the launch of their brand-new Hornet rover. The
rover is set to explore the planet using a simple algorithm. Internally, the rover maintains a direction ordering, a permutation of
the directions north, east, south, and west. When the rover makes
a move, it goes through its direction ordering, chooses the first
direction that does not move it off the face of the planet or onto
an impassable rock, and makes one step in that direction.

Between two consecutive moves, the rover may be hit by a cosmic ray, replacing its direction ordering
with a different one. ICPC scientists have a log of the rover’s moves, but it is difficult to determine by
hand if and when the rover’s direction ordering changed. Given the moves that the rover has made, what
is the smallest number of times that it could have been hit by cosmic rays?

Input
The first line of input contains two integers r and c, where r (1 ≤ r ≤ 200) is the number of rows on the
planet, and c (1 ≤ c ≤ 200) is the number of columns. The rows run north to south, while the columns
run west to east.
The next r lines each contain c characters, representing the layout of the planet. Each character is either
‘#’, a rocky space; ‘.’, a flat space; or ‘S’, a flat space that marks the starting position of the rover.
There is exactly one ‘S’ in the grid.
The following line contains a string s, where each character of s is ‘N’, ‘E’, ‘S’, or ‘W’, representing the
sequence of the moves performed by the rover. The string s contains between 1 and 10 000 characters,
inclusive. All of the moves lead to flat spaces.

Output
Output the minimum number of times the rover’s direction ordering could have changed to be consistent
with the moves it made.

Explanation of Sample 1: The rover’s direction ordering could be as follows. In the first move, it either
prefers to go north, or it prefers to go south and then north. Note that in the latter case, it cannot move
south as it would fall from the face of the planet. In the second move, it must prefer to go north. In the
third move, it must prefer to go east. In the fourth move, it can either prefer to go north, or east and
then north. It is therefore possible that it was hit by exactly one cosmic ray between the second and
third move, changing its direction ordering from N??? to EN?? where ‘?’ stands for any remaining
direction.
